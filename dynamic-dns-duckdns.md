# Dynamic DNS \(with DuckDNS\)

Dynamic DNS will let you access your PiServer over the internet even though your home IP address might be changing, as is common with consumer ISPs.

## Domain

You must have a domain?

## Service & Auto-update Script

Any Dynamic DNS provider can be used, the script to execute is just going to be a little different. We will use DuckDNS because it is free \(accepting donations\).

The DNS configuration... CNAME does what.

The systemd script...

## DNS

You can create more DNS entries.

e.g. cloud.piserver.domain.com -cname-&gt; piserver.domain.com -cname-&gt; you-piserver.duckdns.com -A-&gt; dynamic ip: 151.1.1.1

\(Or alternative naming scheme, just: domain.com/cloud\)
