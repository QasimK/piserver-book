# Monitoring

> Feel free to skip this page and come back to it later.

Monitoring servers is _usually_ important. This includes:

* Resource usage: is the disk getting full? Is the CPU being overloaded?
* Errors: has any service or script experienced a critical error?
* Security: is my server being attacked?

Simple: [https://my-netdata.io/](https://my-netdata.io/) Not really historical past a few hours. Difficult to zoom graphs.

It's important, hence why this page is empty ;\)
