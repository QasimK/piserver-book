# Blog \(with Jekyll\)

A simple static blog \(no server code involved\) can be created with Jekyll. GitHub also supports this, so the only reason you'd want to do it is for HTTPS, which GitHub does not support - yet. You're probably better off waiting.

Alternatively, you can use "smarter" blog software that will support comments or an online CMS.

But in theory... You can certainly host your own website from home!
