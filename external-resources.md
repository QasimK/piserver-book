# External Resources

During the course of writing this book I came across or used a number of resources that you may find helpful when troubleshooting or looking for ideas.

* **Arch Linux Wiki**
* [https://eltechs.com/raspberry-pi-nas-guide/](https://eltechs.com/raspberry-pi-nas-guide/)

The Raspberry Pi can be used for a number of other things than just a Linux server. Some cool things that I've come across include:

* A Magic Mirror \(links\)
* A Retro gaming box \(links\)
* A TV box \(links\)
* Portable \(battery-powered\) wireless station \(links\) - e.g. file share, media streaming, etc.
