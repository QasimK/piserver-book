# External Resources

During the course of writing this book I came across or used a number of resources that you may find helpful when troubleshooting or looking for ideas.

* [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org "The single best resource for Linux-based operating systems!") **\(strongly recommended\)**
* [https://eltechs.com/raspberry-pi-nas-guide/](https://eltechs.com/raspberry-pi-nas-guide/)
* [https://github.com/NicoHood/NicoHood.github.io/wiki/RaspberryPi-Commands](https://github.com/NicoHood/NicoHood.github.io/wiki/RaspberryPi-Commands)

The Raspberry Pi can be used for a number of other things than just a Linux server. Some cool things that I've come across include:

* A Magic Mirror \(links\)
* A Retro gaming box \(links\)
* A TV box \(links\)
* Portable \(battery-powered\) wireless station \(links\) - e.g. file share, media streaming, for car journeys, etc.
