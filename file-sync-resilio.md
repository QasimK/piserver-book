# File Sync App \(with Resilio\)

Resilio is a closed-source-but-free app that does basic file syncing across all devices. It can be used to sync your files without needing two devices on at the same time. It might work without having a plaintext copy, otherwise there is no point.

See alternative: NextCloud

See unwritten alternative: syncthing - doesn't have an iOS app.
