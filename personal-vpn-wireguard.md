# Personal VPN \(with WireGuard\)

We can create a personal VPN to securely gain remote access to your home network.

Maybe also: Device -&gt; Personal VPN \(access home network\) -&gt; VPN provider \(access internet\)?

We use WireGuard because it is easier to configure, more secure, more reliable and more performant, than OpenVPN. However, it is currently in beta, so I guess it's a good thing this guide is a placeholder right now ;\)

\(Alternatives include OpenVPN.\)
